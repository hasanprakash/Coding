* Detecting the loop in the linked list:
	1. Storing the addresses in a map, while iterating check if the address is present in that map or not.
	2. Holding a flag variable in the node. Toggle it for every visit.
	3. Using Floyd Cycle Algorithm, take slow_variable (moves one step in every iteration) and fast_variable
moves 2 steps in every iteration) if they meet -> loop exist. Otherwise not!
